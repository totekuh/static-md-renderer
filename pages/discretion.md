## The Principles of Discretion

To move unseen and unheard through the vast expanse of data:

- **Knowledge is power**: Understanding the tools and methods of digital surveillance is the first step towards privacy.
- **Minimal digital footprint**: The less data one produces, the less there is to be found.
- **Strong encryption**: A fundamental practice to secure communications from prying eyes.
- **Open-source security**: Trust in transparency for robust defense mechanisms.
