## Cryptography Chronicles

Reflecting on the art of secret writing, from ancient ciphers to quantum-resistant algorithms.

- **The evolution of ciphers**: Tracing the journey from simple substitution to complex encryption methods.
- **The cat-and-mouse game**: How advancements in cryptography and cryptanalysis perpetually drive each other.
- **Quantum computing**: Preparing for a future where today's encryption may no longer guarantee security.
- **The importance of key management**: Because even the strongest lock is useless if the key is under the doormat.
